# Tic Tac Toe

## [Link to live preview](https://konstanenonen.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

Tic Tac Toe game. I made this game to practise factory functions and the revealing module patterns in JavaScript. The players are made with a player factory function and the gameboard has a module. Then there is thrid module called game, that uses player factory and gameboard module together to compose the game. This project was a learning task assigned by ## [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe)

## Future improvements

I would like to implement an AI so this could be played in single player mode.
